# DSA1101 Statistical Report - Diabetes Prediction

This repository contains the submission for **DSA1101: Introduction to Data Science**. The project evaluates multiple machine learning models to predict diabetes status using a medical and demographic dataset.

## üèÜ Project Overview
Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder with significant health impacts. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention. This project explores various classification models, including **K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, and Logistic Regression**, to predict diabetes status. The **Decision Tree model** emerged as the best-performing classifier with a **Receiver Operating Characteristic AUC of 0.966**, indicating excellent discriminatory ability for diabetes screening. This report was graded with full marks during AY23/24 Semester 2.
